# MiniUI

MiniUI is a lightweight GUI (Graphical User Interface) framework for the OCaml language. It allows easily building complex immediate mode UIs and while keeping your code simple and easy to manage. Due to being built upon [raylib-ocaml](https://github.com/tjammer/raylib-ocaml) it even allows for making games with a nice looking GUI!
