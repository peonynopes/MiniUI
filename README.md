# MiniUI

MiniUI is a lightweight GUI (Graphical User Interface) framework for the OCaml language. It allows easily building complex immediate mode UIs while keeping your code simple and easy to manage. Due to being built upon [raylib-ocaml](https://github.com/tjammer/raylib-ocaml) it even allows for making games with a nice looking GUI!


## Running the examples

After cloning the repository the MiniUI example can be executed using dune by running:

```sh

in the root folder of the repository.
